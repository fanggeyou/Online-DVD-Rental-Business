# Online-DVD-Rental-Business

This project creates a relational database for an online DVD rental business (similar to Netflix).

In this repository, I created files including SQL scripts for creating tables, indexes, and inserting data into the tables within the database. There is also a file containing advanced SQL queries to improve the performance of this database.

A Visio schema can also be found in this repository, and it is the original schema design of this database.
